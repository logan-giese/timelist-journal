# Timelist Journal
By Logan Giese

### A list-based journaling app for recording the little things in life

## Features

There's a bunch of features here to help you make the most of your memories (and not lose them):

- Security (authentication with Firebase FireAuth)
- Cloud storage (using Firebase FireStore)
- View today's journal (it will be created if you haven't opened it before)
- View recent journals (from the last month)
- Rewind to past journals (search by month or view a specific day's journal)
 - If you view a specific day that doesn't have a journal, the journal will be created
- On a journal page, add bullet-points to record memories
- Export your journals for a chosen date range to a shareable file (available in the side menu)
